        "Message Content": "KUDLOW'S TAKE\nby Lawrence Kudlow\n\n\nMARKET YOUR CALENDAR\nWashington needs to come to its senses.\n\n\n\nEconomic recovery is just around the corner, if you're to believe leading\nofficials at the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and the White House. By\n\"recovery\" they mean a 3% growth rate next year, with high expectations that\nclear rebound evidence will surface during this year's fourth quarter. But\njudging by the continued stock-market plunge, the public is not buying what\nthe government is selling.\n\nThis has been one of the worst summer stock markets in recent history. The\nmuch-heralded summer rally never materialized. In fact, despite repeat Fed\nrate cuts and a federal consumer tax rebate, the technology-driven Nasdaq\nhas lost another 25% of its value in the past three months, with the broader\nS&P 500 index dropping 15%.\n\nTraditionally, stock markets are a leading indicator of the economy. When\nmarkets began hemorrhaging last summer and fall, they correctly signalled\nthe onset of a business slump. This has happened many times in economic\nhistory. Going back 20 years, during the early Reagan administration,\nnational economic gloom was punctured by a big stock-market rally in the\nsecond half of 1982 which correctly heralded the long prosperity boom.\n\nBut it's not happening now. Actually, applying a normal six-to-nine-month\nlead time, stock markets are beginning to signal that no recovery will occur\nuntil the second half of next year.\n\nInvestor spirits and business confidence continues to sink. A daily drum\nbeat of bad earnings reports has overwhelmed the stock markets. Some of the\nnumbers are startling: semiconductor profits are off 85%; telecommunications\nare down 72%; durable-goods are makers off 77% - all for the second quarter.\nLeading surveys now predict an incredible 67% additional drop in technology\nprofits for the third quarter, and perhaps another 40% drop in the fourth.\n\nThe real message coming from the equity market is that the economy is\ngetting worse, not better. Undoubtedly, some of this pessimism springs from\na rather looney-tune debate in Washington, where leading Democrats are\nranting over dwindling budget surpluses, virtually foreclosing any hope of\nadditional and much-needed tax-cut stimulus. Al Gore's old lockbox for\nSocial Security trust funds has resurfaced. And the Bush administration,\nwhich is favorably inclined toward business tax cuts, increasingly finds\nitself boxed in by Social Security scare tactics.\n\nBut there are signs of sanity in Washington. Dan L. Crippen, the head of the\nCongressional Budget Office, testified that \"the attention given to what's\nin the Social Security trust fund come 2015, or even if the trust fund\nexists at that point, is misplaced,\" adding that \"the payroll taxes will\nhave no changes due to the president's tax cut.\" Then, in the most sensible\nstatement to come out of Congress on this debate, Crippen noted, \"What will\nmatter is the size of the economy.\"\n\nBravo. Crippen for president, or Fed chairman, or something. The size of the\neconomy and its ability to grow is the absolute keypoint that is being\nignored in this dreary, Herbert Hoover-like budget debate.\n\nWhile the Bush tax cuts passed by Congress are a move in the right direction\nover the long term, in the short run they are having little or no effect.\nRetailers around the country are reporting virtually no evidence that the\ntax rebates are boosting sales. Even more to the point, the nation is faced\nwith a supply-side business downturn, not a consumer demand-side decline.\nIt's as though the government economic doctors, having made the wrong\ndiagnoses, are now prescribing the wrong remedy.\n\nOn the monetary side, the Fed is finally ending its scorched-earth deflation\nby cutting interest rates and expanding the money supply, which will propel\naggregate demand, not supply. Yet, the collapse of business investment,\nproduction, and profits is a supply-side, or investment-side, problem. The\nright remedy would be across-the-board tax reform to boost work effort and\ncapital formation through lower tax-rate incentives on individuals and\nbusinesses.\n\nBut the tax-rate reduction in the Bush plan doesn't kick in for five years.\nAnd with Democrats ranting over the holy budget surplus, the chance of true\nbusiness tax relief - including measures such as capital gains and\naccelerated depreciation allowances - are minimal.\n\nThe Fed, the White House, and the Treasury should heed the message of the\nreal-world stock market. It is clearly telling us that the economy could be\nmuch worse, and that the role of government policy should be much more\nstimulative on both money and taxes. A combination of supply-side tax cuts\nand greater Fed stimulus will grow the economy, protect Social Security,\nincrease long-term budget surpluses, and preserve America's role as world\nleader.\n\nThe sooner Washington comes to its senses the faster economic recovery will\nbegin."

        "Message Content": "On Saturday, June 9, Tropical Storm Allison left Houston in chaos dumping more than 20 inches of rain and flooding the city in a matter of hours. As of Sunday night, 17 people had died in the storm and many others are still missing. One of those who perished in the fatal flood was one of our employees, a summer intern in ETS and student at Texas A & M University, Chad Garren. Our condolences go out to his family and co-workers. At this time, Enron Community Relations and Aggies@Enron <mailto:Aggies@Enron> are planning to establish a scholarship fund in his memory.  More information on the fund will be forthcoming.\n\nEnron has made a corporate contribution of $500,000 to the American Red Cross to aid in the victim relief effort. Enron employees are encouraged to donate to relief efforts and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.   Enron will match your contribution dollar for dollar and your donation will not be counted against your $15,000 annual limit.\n\nAlthough Enron is supporting the American Red Cross, please feel free to make your donation to the non-profit organization of your choice that is offering aid to flood victims (they must provide proof of their 501c 3 status). Please send your check to EB1635a before Friday, June 15, and we will send it, along with a matching check to the appropriate agency.  On the memo line of your check, please make sure to write \"Houston Flood Relief.\"  \n\nWe know that many Enron employees have been severely impacted by this devastating flood. Enron cares about you and your family and would like to make sure that your immediate needs are being met. If you have been displaced because of the flood, please contact the Community Relations hotline at ext. 37181 for assistance. Also, if you would like to help your co-workers who have been displaced, an account has been set up at the Enron Federal Credit Union to accept donations. Please bring/send your contribution to the Enron Federal Credit Union and make your checks out to Employee Flood Relief .\n\nThere are many agencies in Houston in need of volunteer assistance. If you would like to volunteer, please e-mail your name and extension to communityrelations@enron.com <mailto:communityrelations@enron.com>. Please note if you are willing to lead a project.\n\nAgain, our hearts go out to Chad's family and to all of you who have been impacted by this tragedy. Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information."

        "Message Content": "Here's the activist thinking\nof the other half of the\nWood-Brownell team\n___\n\nThis FERC isn't like any\nFERC you've known or\nworked with recently\n\nIf you don't like markets, here's the very bad news.\n     \"This FERC is all about markets and everything we do is going to be guided\nby that,\" Nora Mead Brownell reminded.\n     She intends being a one term (five years) member who has her work cut out\nfor her -- building market infrastructure.\n     \"Not retrenching and not recreating, we are going to be defining and\ndirecting and collaborating to transform ourselves as we make the markets work -\n- creating policies that make markets work.\"\n     Look for some \"very specific business planning and strategy so there will\nbe no doubt about what's coming.  It won't be the surprise of the hour or `I\ndon't know what that FERC is all about.`\"\n     What does she think of the MORC room -- the market observation resource\ncenter at FERC where five people can watch transactions and prices\nreal time?\n     \"It's a good first step but it needs further development,\" she replied.\n     The agency needs people who've worked in markets and have real world experience\non energy trading floors, Brownell noted.\n     Brownell is not much for rulemaking but early on \"you've got to set the\nguideposts\" especially where the \"power of the incumbent is very, very strong.\"\n     \"If you don't have any rules in place you can't find anybody guilty,\" she\nnoted, \"cause there's no crime.\"\n     It's been noticed that the market-based rates were not conditioned on\ncertain behavior, such as:\n     \"If you engage in the following behavior it's a no-no.\"\n     There may have been behavior in the market \"of which you and I would\ndisapprove but if it's not in the Ten Commandments, it's hard to take somebody\nout to the woodshed.\"\n     Meanwhile, we expect the White House to give FERC a fifth member who will\nprovide a market-oriented vote.  Is there any doubt in Brownell's mind?\n     \"Not in mine.  President Bush has been very, very clear about his\nphilosophy on markets for a long time,\" she said.\n     Brownell is excited about the opportunity the new commission has \"to make a\ndifference.\"\n     \"We better make a difference.\"\n     For her, the issues are bigger than jurisdiction and even markets.  What's\nat stake in her mind is creating an economic environment in which people invest\nin infrastructure.  \"If we don't really begin to take advantage of that\nopportunity there's going to be an enormous price to pay.  We saw it in the West\nand we're about to see it in lots of other places.\n     \"It's what drove me to feel so strongly about those RTOs.  I know that's\ncomplicated and we have work to do but when I see unnecessary costs in the price\nof electricity I know what happens to the end user, the small businessman the\nbig users and the retail customers on limited income.\n     \"If we can solve the problem and we can focus on the problem the\njurisdiction answers will come or they'll be so clear that it will be\nunavoidable.\n     \"Rather than start with who's going to do what, we should start with what\ndo we need to do to build the backbone for this country to continue to grow,\"\nshe explained.\n     It's her goal to recast the debate on \"what this is all about.\"  Her view\nis that \"it's about economic development -- plain and simple.\"\n     How about making progress in bringing market forces to bear on transmission\ncosts?\n     Maybe an auction of capacity as with gas capacity.\n     Brownell wants to know more about the proposal before expressing a view.\n     Without RTOs and transparency in the market, she's skeptical \"that that can\nhappen.\"\n     How can you bring market forces into transmission, we asked.\n     She sees RTOs fostering market forces to bear because the market will have\nconfidence that there will be equity and opportunity.\n     \"Until we resolve the issue of access and structural management, no capital\nwill flow.\"  For her, the capital flow is the proof that a market is working.\n     Those two issues, if unresolved, prevent innovation, she added.\n     Brownell cited congestion pricing that rewards congestion, \"if you happen to\nbe the guy who owns the line that's creating it,\" Brownell explained, \"having\nthe opposite effect.\"\n     The massive structural changes that cause some consternation in the\ncommunity are what's necessary.\n     She doesn't want to wake up two years from now and realize \"either we've\ntotally destroyed the markets and therefore totally put our country's\ndevelopment back five years because we have no investment and no plants and no\nreal reliability oversight -- nor do I want to create a system in which we have\nunregulated monopolies as in the telecom industry.\n     \"You saw that wonderful burst of new technologies and the long distance\nprices dropping that no one ever imagined.\"\n     Brownell expects that kind of technological explosion in energy but we\nhaven't seen it yet.\n     When a market really drives the energy field, she predicted fuel cells that\nwork in a short period of time or we'll see 50 new things.\n     Those who believe the old system works just fine win no brownie points with\nBrownell.  \"It wasn't supporting growth.  It wasn't terribly efficient.\n     \"I didn't notice a lot of innovation.  Frankly I don't miss my old, black\nrotary phone.  I'm not going to miss my clunky, 40-year old plant.  I'd like to\nhave distributed generation right at my back door.\n     \"And then it became more and more clear that the (telecom) market was not\nworking to everyone's advantage, was not equitable and you had this meltdown and\nyou now have unregulated monopolies.\"\n     In electricity that would be a tragedy and the cost would be even greater\nthan with regulated ones, she said.\n     What kind of changes would Brownell like to see at FERC?\n     New ways of problem solving.  \"Markets do not wait 15 months or 11 months\nwhile you go through the ritualized process... Not just with FERC but anybody\nthat has to observe due process.\"\n     But when the Pennsylvania PUC implemented the retail power marketing,\nstakeholder from the marketers, the incumbent, operations people, not lawyers,\nran into problems daily.\n     The PUC created a team under Kevin Cadden who's joined FERC as external\naffairs director.\n     The Cadden team met three times a week in the first couple of weeks to deal\nwith problems of multiple scheduling coordinators and Cadden had the authority\nto make decisions at the meetings.\n     Where there was a huge policy impact he would go to commissioners for\nnotational voting.\n     That meant that stakeholders couldn't go commissioner shopping -- \"a big\nsport in Pennsylvania, people got real serious about it and they solved the\nproblems.\"\n     Brownell wants to see that methodology in Washington.  \"We need to find\nways to build up the trust here.\n     \"The best thing in the world that could have happened in the California\nsituation or the western mitigation is for all those people to get in a room and\nsettle,\"  Brownell advised.\n     Her fear is that FERC will make a decision and it will be litigated for five years\nleaving everyone -- the agency, the companies and the customers -- exposed\nto the vicissitudes of the courts.\n     We noted that it's been about five years in New Hampshire from enactment to\nimplementation.\n     Brownell favors non-traditional ways of solving problems -- the use of\n\"swat teams of people starting with say 10 real smart state commissioners\" to\nget in a room to come up with options to prevent congestion pricing for example\n\"and then we'll have an open hearing and talk about it.\"\n     Brownell is a big supporter of Chairman Pat Wood's operational switch away\nfrom the method of recent FERC leaders whereby members' staffs carry around\nnotes and ideas from commissioner to commissioner until an accord is struck.\n     Then the decision is presented as a done deal with written-in-advance\nspeeches read at voting.\n     The commission in effect says \"here is the right answer,\" Brownell claims.\n     Wood's plan is to have open debate.\n     \"It's a great idea,\" Brownell said.  \"It encourages our staffs to think in\na safe environment instead of just being told what the answer is.\"\n     FERC members have talented staffers who need to be encouraged to come up\nwith \"and get out\" imaginative solutions, she observed.\n     The open debate \"let's us signal to people how we're thinking and where\nwe're going.\"\n     \"We're talking at meetings because we want ideas.  We want to explore all\nthe options and not come in and say `here is the right answer.'\n     \"There are probably 10 right answers,\" Brownell reminded.\n     Many sacrifices so far:  On a personal note, leaving Pennsylvania when she\ndid, Brownell lost a newly enacted pension for state government employees.\n     Had she hung on three more weeks she would have gotten a pension but the\nurgency of big votes on California and the RTOs was such that she thought it\nwrong to sit around in Harrisburg waiting for the money.\n     \"The last thing I wanted was to have the lights go out in California and\nhave me sitting there (in Harrisburg),\" she observed.\n     While the FERC pay of $125,700 is greater than the PUC's $105,086 the cost\nof living in the Nation's Capitol is much, much higher.\n     The PUC provides a car and doesn't charge commissioners monthly parking.\n     Brownell bought a home on Capitol Hill and will be able to walk in good\nweather but will still have to pay the monthly parking.\n\nThe is part two of a two part series and I'd love to send you part one and our Pat\nWood interview too - simply write to season@restructuringtoday.com and I'll\nrush them to you.\n\nCan you move into this big news autumn without Restructuring Today handy every\nday?

        "Message Content": "Good morning Mr. Skilling.\n\n\nWhen I arrive at work today the only e-mail I had was the EES Distribution, and my first though  \nwas great my day is going to go well. When I open and realised it was an opportunity to ask you a \nquestion, I though long and hard about it. The reasons being is that most of the little people in a company \nof this size never really get their voices heard on any issue,  and being a contractor make it even harder \nso why would this be any different. Another concern was,  will a person like yourself really have time in your \nbusy schedule to read and answer every e-mail, phone call all or written correspondence he receives from an employee.\n But Mr Skilling I am taking the chance that you yourself  can hear this voice .\n\nMy question to you this morning is very important to me and I am quite sure to many others like myself.\n\nI would like to know  why is it that Enron spend so much money, training and time on contractors like myself, only to turn around and hire someone\nelse to do the same job that the contractors are doing already. Wouldn't it be easier  and cheaper to offer the job to the contractor,\nor just give them the opportunity to accept or decline the offer.?\n\n\nMr. Skilling I think that  Enron is a great company to work for because of all the information, that I have learned in my eight months of employment.\nBut like most company their is always room for improvements. Also Mr. Skilling this is not a pitch for employment, it just a question of concern.\nThank you for the opportunity to speak with you.\n\nI wish that your day will be a great and less busy one. Have a great day.\n\n\nHope to hear from you soon."

A few weeks ago, I received in the mail a Enron newsletter which contained a feature of you and your interests. While reading the article, I noticed that you're into \"Anything Africa.\" Two years ago, I was working in Ghana, West Africa on a cogen plant with Stone & Webster. Most US. citizens have no idea what the conditions are like in these 3rd world countries. \nI was curious as to how many trips you've made to the sub-Saharan section of the continent and to which countries you have visited.\nEarlier, I was discussing my African experience with Marty Sunde. I sent him a few ebony wood carvings purchased from the local villagers. These pieces were hand carved by artisans in the area.  If you have a moment, you should stop by his office on the 8th floor where he has them on display.\nI have also attached the files containing a few digital photo's from the area where I lived and worked. These are primarily photos from the local villages near the plant.\nWhile you're viewing the photos, you should be able to recognize me. I'm the only American looking individual in the tribe.\nEnjoy\n\nTom Mashington"

Traditional database replication is great for local area\nreplication within one data center.  Once you scale to multiple data\ncenters, traditional replication is unreliable, complicated to set up and\nmanage, and very expensive.\n\nZembu's software was designed to address this exact problem.

        "Message Content": "Dear Ken: \nThis note builds on the earlier voice mail, and a memorandum I have sent to  \nyou, following the Dave Dorman meeting. Given the initial ground work done by  \nour team at ATT leadership level, the meeting between Jeff and David Dorman,  \nwe think did go as expected by us. I am sure Dave and Stewart, along with  \nJeff have shared their views of the meeting, and do feel positive about  the  \nprocess forward. \nOur take on the meeting is as follows: \n1. Dave Dorman is open and eager to explore ways ATT and Enron could  \ncooperate across the board. \n2. Dave wants to move fast, but at a pace that will work within ATT, and is  \nstrategically sound for both the organizations \n3. He is now looking forward to specific value propositions from  \nEnron-Adventis team, which he is prepared to discuss with us. \n4. On that basis I am sure he will guide us to the most appropriate guys  \nwithin ATT who will need to understand and act on the value propositions. \nIn view of the above the real work begins now. As discussed with Dave and  \nStewart, we will further reinforce our commitment to develop, and take the  \nbasic proposals with ATT forward. Our team is already on the job and will  \nmeet with Stewart early this week. \nI did indicate to both Dave and Stewart that we will like to take the next  \nsteps in a most expeditious and matured fashion so that all the strategic  \npossibilities to create the new bandwidth dynamics between the two companies  \ncould be achieved. \nGiven that there were some hesitation within Enron on the out come of the  \nfirst meeting with ATT, we committed to the last 2.5 weeks of work with a  \nreduced fee structure. Now that the first major step has been successfully  \ntaken, we plan to work with you along our normal professional fee schedule.  \nAs we do want to move as fast as possible and if at any point indications are  \nthat the desired out come will be difficult to achieve we could stop and  \nreview progress. As a result, although not common, we are willing to work  \nwith a weekly rate, adjusted to professional fees of $75,000/week and out of  \npocket expenses. In addition of course for an engagement of this nature which  \nessentially leverages our firms professional credibility and trust in the  \nindustry, our clients pay us on the basis of successful execution of the  \nalliance formation along preset milestones.  \nGiven the strategic nature of this engagement, and our commitment to assist  \nyou with all the major Telcos, -- incumbents and new, we will welcome to  \nlearn from you the basic structure of a formula which Enron is most  \ncomfortable with; typically in other situations in my professional life, we  \nhave been rewarded in three stages: \n1. On signing of  the letter of intent(s) \n2. On  signing of the agreement(s) \n3. On launch of the first project (s) \nKen, while we look forward to formalizing the above, please enure we sustain  \nand if not increase the momentum gained from the first summit meeting last  \nThursday. If we do the right things, the upside is indeed huge. We of course  \nshould also start thinking through how to build the same kind of work  \ndynamics with the other Telcos, in most we do enjoy similar professional  \ntrust. \nWe will call you tomorrow to firm up the next 3 -4 weeks of  work --  \ndocumentation of value propositions, actions, meetings, and decisions. \nRegards, \nPartha S Ghosh"

The purpose of this e-mail is to outline the issues that w=\ne have encountered and what we are doing to resolve the issues.=20\n?=09During the last week of August, we encountered a bug in Microsoft's Exc=\nhange Server -- the mail server that is used by Outlook clients.  This bug,=\n which impacted approximately 3,000 users, delayed mail delivery for the be=\ntter part of a day.  At that time, we applied a fix from Microsoft which ap=\npears to have resolved the problem.  We have carefully monitored the Exchan=\nge servers for four weeks, and have not seen a re-occurrence of the bug.\n?=09Also during the last week of August, another Exchange Server experience=\nd database corruption issues -- again, this impacted approximately 3,000 Ou=\ntlook users.  To resolve this, we moved the 3,000 users to different Exchan=\nge servers and made several hardware/software upgrades to the affected serv=\ner.  We have not yet returned the repaired server to full production use --=\n we are closely monitoring it to ensure that there are no more problems wit=\nh the server.  While this event did not cause e-mail outages during the bus=\niness week, we had to do maintenance on the server during the evenings on W=\nednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and throughout the Labor day weekend to mov=\ne users to different servers.  During these evenings and weekend, the impac=\nted users could not access their e-mail.\n?=09During the last three weeks, there have been a number of new and danger=\nous viruses on the internet.  We have a multi-layered defense against virus=\nes that include virus scanning software on servers and desktops.  All mail =\nis scanned on the Exchange servers and all files are scanned on the desktop=\ns.  During the last few weeks, we have had to apply numerous virus scanning=\n updates to the Exchange servers - sometimes even several updates per day. =\n The result is that when new virus scanning updates arrive, the performance=\n of the Exchange servers diminishes for several hours while the anti-virus =\nproduct rescans every message in every mailbox.  This is unfortunate, but w=\ne believe necessary to prevent viruses from causing outages in the Enron co=\nmputing environment and threaten our revenue generating systems.  At this t=\nime, we are working with the vendor to arrive at a technical solution that =\nwill speed up the virus scanning process.  We have made some progress as th=\ne performance has improved during virus scans, however, it can continue to =\nget better.\nThere is no question that the email issues we have encountered over the las=\nt few weeks are unacceptable.  We are continuing to monitor and improve the=\n overall performance to ensure that we substantially reduce the outages and=\n meet Enron's business needs and expectations.\n\nEnron Global Technology"
